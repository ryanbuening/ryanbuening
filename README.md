# Working with me

#### I...

- enjoy working alone or with a small group of people.
- crave quiet time to think and reflect. I need time to think through ideas and solutions.
- am extremely organized in my work and personal goals and plans.
- learn best by reading and doing.
- shy away from demanding things and tend to build support for my ideas through prototypes and demonstrations.
- can be reluctant to give negative feedback or criticism. I find I need to establish rapport and safety with others before I can offer advice.
- do everything in my power to follow through on my commitments. I don't like making commitments I don't think I can meet.
- expect others to follow through on their commitments and will communicate with me if things change.
- do not tend to show my emotions publicly. I need a more intimate environment.
